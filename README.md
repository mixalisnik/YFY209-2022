## Decription
In this project we calculate the configurational entropy for cold white dwarves.  
First we solve the Lane-Emden equation and we calculate the Normalized modal fraction  for
sample values of the polytropic index γ. We plot the results in figure 1.  
Then, we find the Configurational Entropy and Mass of the white dwarves for several values of the polytropic index γ.  
We plot the results in figure 2.  
In figure 3, we plot the Sα^3 quantity for several values of the polytropic index, for three different infrared cutoff values.
